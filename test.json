  "prompt": "Wide cinematic shot of an active construction site inside a wooden framed building. Several real human construction workers are spraying polyurethane foam insulation onto the walls using professional spray hoses, wearing white protective suits, gloves, goggles, and respirators. The ambient sound includes machinery, air compressors, and spraying noise.\n\nIn the center of the scene is the exact same Aztec warrior character from the provided image. This character must be used exactly as shown, with the same stylized/cartoon design, colors, proportions, outfit, and facial features. Do NOT replace him with a human, do NOT humanize or redraw him, and do NOT change his anatomy, proportions, colors, outfit, or face.\n\nThe character is also spraying foam insulation on the wall, working just like the other workers. Add only modern protective gear on top of his existing outfit (safety helmet, clear safety glasses, work gloves, and a reflective vest) without altering or covering his design.\n\nThe camera slowly pushes in (zooms) toward his face as he stops, looks directly at the camera, and in a deep and confident voice says: \"Azteca Insulation LLC â€” Comfort You Can Feel.\"\n\nThen the camera pulls back (zooms out), showing him smiling and returning to spray insulation alongside the other workers.\n\nConstraints: No on-screen text, captions, or logos. Maintain realistic ambient construction sounds. Preserve the exact character model as provided, without any modifications.",
